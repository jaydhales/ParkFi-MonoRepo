# ParkFi

ParkFi is your go-to solution for convenient and secure parking. Our platform is designed to simplify the process of finding and reserving parking spots, making it easy to park anywhere in the city. By partnering with existing parking spaces, we tokenize them as Park Space NFTs, enhancing their security and value.

## Introduction

ParkFi revolutionizes the parking experience by allowing users to find and reserve parking spots with ease. By tokenizing parking spaces as NFTs, we provide a more secure and valuable system for parking space owners. Additionally, ParkFi offers a membership model that allows users to park at reduced rates, with benefits such as individual recording and tracking of each space and its amenities.

## Features

- **Easy Reservation:** Find and reserve parking spots effortlessly.
- **Tokenized Parking Spaces:** Parking spaces are secured and made more valuable by tokenizing them as NFTs.
- **Affordable Rates:** Lower transaction fees compared to traditional parking methods.
- **Membership Benefits:** Discounted rates, priority reservations, and access to exclusive parking spaces.

## How It Works

### Membership

Users can become members by minting a Membership NFT, which allows them to park at any space within the network at a reduced rate.

### Parking Space

Parking space owners can mint Parking Space NFTs, making their spaces available for reservation on the ParkFi platform.

### Check-In and Check-Out

Members can check into a parking space for a specified duration (hourly or daily) and are charged accordingly. Overstay fees are applied if the space is used beyond the reserved duration.

## Verification

We use zkPass to verify members and owners using their legal identities. This verification process can be completed through major exchanges such as OKX, Bybit, or Binance. This ensures the legitimacy and security of all participants on the ParkFi platform.

## Deployment

The ParkFi platform is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can interact with the contracts using compatible wallets such as MetaMask.
